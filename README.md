## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript and HTML DOM
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Provides testing server, build tools, etc.





### Continued development

The transition animation on the accordion looks a little weird - I will look at improving this in the future. 

Also the overflow for the main graphic on the desktop site needs to be hidden without hiding it for the package icon - I tried several ways to do this and none worked, but I will look into other methods if they exist.

### Useful resources

- [How to Create an Accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - this helped with the FAQ accordion layout.
- [ How To Create An FAQ Accordion Menu Using Only HTML & CSS ](https://www.foolishdeveloper.com/2021/01/accordion-menu.html) - This helped with the arrows at the right of the FAQ question elements. The tutorial also included an accordion setup without JS, which I will consider doing in future to improve performance.
